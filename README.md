## User Stories
- As a user, when the application first loads, I want to see a map centered on my current location, with a marker representing my current location.
- As a user, I want to see a message above my current location, prompting me to sign in to save a parking location.
- As a user, upon signing in, I want to see a 'Park Now' button appear.
- As a user, upon signing in, I want to see a marker representing my current parking location, if there is one.
- As a user, when I click 'Park Now', I want to be able to attach a note to the parking location, and then save the parking location to the database.
- As a user, when a parking location saves to the database, I want to see a car icon appear at that location on the map.
- As a user, I want to be able to center the map on either my current location, or my current parking location.
- As a user, I want to know the current distance between my current location and my car (and potentially visualize a route between current location and parking location).
- As a user, when I click on my parking location icon, I want the option to edit the note attached to the parking spot.
- As a user, I want the ability to reposition my current location marker by dragging it, so that I can assure accuracy when saving a parking location.
